Hi, there! I'm Jingyuan Zhang, a fourth-year undergraduate student advised by [Prof. Xiaolin Huang](http://www.pami.sjtu.edu.cn/En/xiaolin) from [Institute of Image Processing and Pattern Recognition](http://www.pami.sjtu.edu.cn/). 

I'm expected to receive B.Eng in Automation with a minor in Finance in June 2026 from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). Previously, I was fortunate to collabrated with [Prof. Yulun Zhang](https://yulunzhang.com/) from [Artificial Intelligence Institute](https://ai.sjtu.edu.cn/) in Model Compression. I was also a visiting student at [School of Computing, National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/) in summer 2023 and Department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University](https://ece.ncsu.edu/) in summer 2025.

My research interests include Large Language Model, Machine Learning, Diffusion Model, Computer Vision and Model Compression. I'm open to any collaborations! Feel free to drop me an email for casual chat!
